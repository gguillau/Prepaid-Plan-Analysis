### Project Setup
You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans is more profitable in order to adjust the advertising budget.

You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan is more profitable.

Skills Used: Statistical Data Analysis

### Conclusion
The objective of this project is to analyze Megaline clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan is more profitable based on 2018 data provided from a sample of 500 Megaline clients.

Below are insights discovered regarding client behavior:

* Surf clients account for 68% of total clients in contrast to 36% Ultimate clients

* 19% calls had a duration of 0 minutes and 13% internet sessions used 0 MB.

* The average call minutes used per month are around 400 regardless of the plan

* Ultimate clients are barely reaching their call minutes limit (3000 included)

* Ultimate clients never exceed their call minutes included in contrast to 35% of Surf clients

* Ultimate clients send an average of 46 text messages per month out of the 1000 message limit included with the plan.

* Surf clients send 39 text messages per month out of the 50 message limit included with the plan.

* 21% surf clients exceed their included messages and payed extra fees compared to 0% of Ultimate clients, most likely due to each plan's respective message limit.

* 57% of Surf client exceed the gb included per month limit and payed extra fees compared to only 5% of Ultimate Clients.

* 72% of Surf clients payed extra fees in contrast to 3% of Ultimate clients.

* The average revenue for clients of the ultimate plan is \$71 whereas the average revenue for clients of the surf plan is $52

* Results from the hypothesis tests indicate that there is:

* no significant difference between the average revenue of NY-NJ region and other regions.
there is a significant difference between the average monthly price of ultimate clients vs surf clients

In conclusion, The Ultimate plan is more profitable for Megaline than the surf plan. Although Surf clients are much more likely to pay extra fees (72% percent vs 3% for ultimate), the median extra fees payed per client is around 40 USD , which is still less than the \$70 monthly charge that ultimate clients pay.
